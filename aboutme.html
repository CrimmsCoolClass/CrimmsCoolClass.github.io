        <p>Hello! My name is Alex. I'm an electronics engineer with the 402nd Software Engineering Group (United States Air Force). My main passion is Antenna and Microwave engineering but due to being a teaching assistant for so many years, I am quite fond of digital design and FPGAs. Outside of work I am an avid tennis player despite being quite rubbish at it. My GitHub username and, obstensibly, this website are named after Professor Lance Crimm of KSU/Southern Polytechnic. Lance is quite a fun and cool (haha) guy (and a monster at racquetball). He was among my favorite professors during my undergrad, along with Dr. Theodore Grosch, Charles Duvall, and Caroline Cranfill. It is my earnest hope that this website can be of use to anyone who stumbles across it.
