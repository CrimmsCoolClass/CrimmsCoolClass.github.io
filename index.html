        <p>I know this looks like the crappiest website on planet Earth. I am not a web developer, that is my brother's forte.
            What matters is why this exists. I, like many other people, find very interesting educational resources on the web. So much so, that
            my bookmarks fill up. Think of this as a "best of" for that sort of thing.
